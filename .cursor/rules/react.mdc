## TypeScript

- Do not use explicit return types unless absolutely necessary to resolve typing issues.

## CSS / Tailwind CSS

- Always use `size-5` instead of `h-5 w-5`

## Barrel files

- Never add to an existing barrel file or create one; we want to migrate away from them whenever possible. New imports should always be explicit.
