// We have those linters in other projects, hande i18n issues.
// However, I am not sure which ruleset this is.
// It might be part of `jsx-a11y`.
// In addition, in tarmac-app we have rules like
// - underscore variables
// - ts-ignore allowed when paired with comment
//
// We also need to figure out how to add them here.
