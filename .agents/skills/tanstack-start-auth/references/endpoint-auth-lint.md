# Endpoint Auth Lint Pattern

Auth-boundary rules enforced by Oxlint custom plugins.

## Intent

Every server boundary must make an auth decision first. The first non-empty statement should say one of:

- this boundary requires a session/admin/project role/API key
- this boundary is intentionally public, with a reason
- auth is inherited or delegated elsewhere, with a reason

This makes missing auth visible in review and machine-checkable by Oxlint.

## Oxlint plugins

Wire local ESLint-compatible rules as Oxlint `jsPlugins` in `oxlint.config.mjs`:

- `lint/plugins/require-endpoint-auth.mjs` — `src/routes/api/**/*.ts`, route `beforeLoad`, `src/server/**/*.server.ts`
- `lint/plugins/no-auth-boundary-import.mjs` — blocks direct imports from low-level auth/session helpers outside `src/server/auth/`
- `lint/utils/endpoint-auth-ast.mjs` — AST helper for `endpointAuth.*` and allowed route auth functions

Copy from [trassenscout `lint/`](https://github.com/FixMyBerlin/trassenscout/tree/develop/lint) when adopting in a new app. Base oxlint setup: `tech-stack` → [oxc-config.md](../../tech-stack/references/oxc-config.md).

The public API is `src/server/auth/endpointAuth.server.ts`. Boundary functions start with calls like:

```ts
await endpointAuth.session(headers)
await endpointAuth.admin(headers)
await endpointAuth.projectRole(headers, projectSlug, roles)
endpointAuth.apiKey(request)
endpointAuth.public("public survey submission with token validation")
endpointAuth.inherited("auth enforced in serveProjectUploadObject")
```

`public(...)` and `inherited(...)` require a non-empty string literal reason.

## Route auth exception

Route auth is still layout `beforeLoad`, not middleware.

Route layouts call a closed set of route server functions from `src/server/auth/auth.functions.ts`:

- `routeGuestFn`
- `routeSessionFn`
- `routeAdminFn`
- `routeProjectFn`

The lint helper allowlists exactly those names as valid first statements in `beforeLoad`. They wrap the same session/project checks but throw TanStack `redirect(...)` for page UX. `endpointAuth.session(...)` and `endpointAuth.projectRole(...)` throw `AuthorizationError`, so they are for API/server data boundaries, not route redirects.

## Do not convert this to middleware

Do not present request middleware or global function middleware as the FMC auth-route solution. Use this pattern:

- route UX/auth redirects: layout `beforeLoad` + route server functions
- data/API security: `endpointAuth.*` or domain guards as the first boundary statement
- public RPCs: `public*.functions.ts` and explicit `endpointAuth.public(...)` / token validation where needed
